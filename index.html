         <h1>Introduction</h1>
         <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
  
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
           for example:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
             </li>
             <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
  
            </li>
  
           </ul>

           <h1>What you should already know</h1> 
            <p> This guide assumes you have the following basic background: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>

          <h1>Hello world</h1> 
          <p> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code </p>
          <code>
            if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 <br><br>
  This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.<br> <br>
  
  if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
  defined
          </code>

           <h1>Global variables</h1>
           <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
           <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
